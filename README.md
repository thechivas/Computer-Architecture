During the course of this subject, we have done different activities such as creating a web page by initializing a server in Oracle VM.

Virtual Box is an application owned by Oracle, and is one of the most popular because of its open source, being a free application and can be run on any operating system.

A virtual machine is a virtualization package that is installed in an operating system as an application, in short terms, is to have a computer inside our computer.
When creating a virtual machine however, there are some limitations, as the components we use are stored in a virtual machine and does not take full advantage of the hardware.

As an essential first step we proceeded to download and install VirtualBox from its website:
Https://www.virtualbox.org/.
# Week 1 - (First Attempt to Install Ubuntu Server)
Once downloaded we proceed to install Ubuntu Server. During the first week it was almost impossible for most of the students because they did not have the necessary resources and there was still a lack of knowledge about the basics of the project.
# Week 2 - (Ubuntu Server Installation 16.04)
During the following week this problem could be solved by what could be done to install the program, I personally decided to acquire the file through a classmate to speed up the process.

Once we acquired the file Ubuntu Server OS 16.04, we proceeded to create a virtual machine using the already installed Virtual VM, we had to enter data in several options like the Name, type of operating system and its version. We must assign a Ram Memory to our virtual machine so I have decided to apply a third of the capacity of my computer. Then we had to allocate a memory capacity, on the advice of the teacher to allocate 20Gb of capacity which gave me a bit of mistrust in saying that I should format that date. Note that it is completely safe to use a virtual machine and it will not make any changes to our equipment.

After the creation of the virtual machine, we proceed to mount the image of the Ubuntu file in the main panel of Virtual VM and continue with our installation. After installed, I had to follow a series of instructions that gave the program among these the creation of a user name and a password. This was one of my biggest obstacles for the moment given that at the time of closing and running the program repeatedly I was unable to access using the data I had already entered. Try to get help with the teacher and some classmates but noting that several of these had the same drawback I decided to do the installation again. (It also required reviewing and analyzing every step taken to install Ubuntu).

As soon as I achieved my goal with Virtual VM, we accessed GitHub.com to start getting familiar with that website. I was able to successfully complete the 'Hello Word' and 'Getting Started with GitHub Pages' tutorials, however with a bit of difficulty since I did not understand the code perfectly or for what we could use this page.

# Week 3 - (Apache Server Installation)
Starting the week with the Apache Web Server installation, which is one of the most used servers worldwide, because of its higher characteristics such as speed, security and a completely free server. This can be customized according to the needs of the client.
Apache has the function of evaluating requests for pages and resources made by users and managing their acceptance or denial according to established security policies.
That said, we started our installation by checking any type of update that could be available and then installing the web server following the parameters given by the teacher. At the time of the search the server encountered the problem of logging in Virtual VM, the machine did not recognize the information that had been introduced in previous days, restarting the same and still presented the same problem. Almost over, I decided to restart the computer to enter the program again and in the third login attempt I was able to enter my Server.

I deduced that it is possible to have been a mistake that was presented in the program on my computer at the moment of entering the characters.
After entering the address http: // localhost: 80, it was working.

# Installing MySQL, PHP and Modules.
Upon completion of the installation of Apache Server, we proceeded to install the aforementioned open source Database programs. These are mainly used for adding some features for creating and editing modern servers.
No inconvenience arose during the installation of these and later
Verification using the localhost / info.php link.


# Week 4 - (Installation of Content Management System / Wordpress)

During this week we proceed to install WordPress, which in simple words is a platform where you can write, modify articles and create a web page or server. The CMSs consist of computer programs full of databases that facilitate the creation and management of content.
Previously to modify a web page it was necessary to know the programming language in which it was designed and to make the desired modifications directly from the code.
With content managers such as CMS this is no longer necessary so it is much easier to manage and edit our web page.
Among the main uses of wordpress we have:
- Creation of webpages.
- Blogs
- Forums
- Online Stores

Wordpress also has 2 main features like:
Templates (themes or designs for your site): They are used in WordPress to modify the appearance and design of the site. There are plenty of free themes that help to adapt WordPress to any type of user need.
 Plug ins (applications to develop any site in mind): They are add-ons used to improve WordPress in different areas such as marketing, social networking, web design, security, etc.
 
 Now for the installation of WordPress in our virtual machine we proceeded to download using the codes given by the teacher.

Once the installation was done we proceeded with the creation of MySQL which is one of the most widely used content management system in the world. This is a system that allows us through a series of statements, have information stored in a database and retrieve it when we need it in an efficient and fast way.
One of my biggest difficulties during the whole project would be the configuration of MySQL, when trying to create a database I generate an error continuously with respect to the Login data and once past this stage I was facing another problem by the Lack of a document in the program.
Try to look for support but no one understood the problem. After hundreds of attempts I decided to go one step back and install Wordpress again using all the codes given in class.
It was my surprise that Wordpress started after doing such a procedure.
When installed this takes you behind a simple form in which you must enter the access data to the server.
Once this was done, the website was opened so that we could begin to familiarize ourselves with its editing options, I personally decided to make some modifications regarding the theme change and the cover text to later make the presentation of the project.
